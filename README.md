# UFOs
Creating Dynamic Content with Javascript

# Project Overview
The purpose of the project is to build HTML page which will guide users to extract information from JavaScript data file by adding filters on the page. So the filters will allow users to filter multiple criteria at the same time.

When clients visit the website, clients will be able to navigate through the website effortlessly. Clients will land on the page viewing the image and title on the site. They can navigate through the website by scrolling down to see other features such as the data and filters. There are filters such as date, city, state,country, and shape, that can allow users to filter multtiple criteria at same time. (See image below)

# Summary
The website is a beautiful one and the page has table filters that allows filtering by city, state,country, and shape. However, longitude and latitudes are not included in the search criteria as client may like to locate the exact location of UFO. There are no pictures in UFO's website. 
I recommend adding API call for latitude and longitude and more search criteria as well as adding more pictures to the website.
